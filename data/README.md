**English Examples:**
- "Help me!" - in panic tone
- "Stop it!" - in aggressive tone
- "Leave me alone!" - in fearful tone

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

Use this format: `{class}_{identifier}.wav`

**Examples:**

---

## Workflow

1. **Record** your audio files
2. **Save** them in `data/raw/` with proper naming
3. **Run** the organization script
4. **Verify** the dataset report
5. **Augment** to increase dataset size

---

## Quality Checklist

Before augmentation, ensure:
- [ ] At least 150-200 original samples per class
- [ ] Clear distinction in TONE (not words)
- [ ] Consistent recording device
- [ ] Proper file naming
- [ ] All files are playable

---

**Dataset Statistics**: python -c "from src.data_organizer import DataOrganizer; org = DataOrganizer('.'); org.dataset_dir = org.project_root / 'data' / 'augmented'; org.generate_dataset_report()"

**Remember**: The model learns EMOTION/TONE, not the actual words!
Same phrase in different tones = different classes! üéØ
